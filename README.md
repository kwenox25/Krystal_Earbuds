# Dahilan_KwencyMaye_Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Kwency Dahilan and I am a graduating student from the Interactive Media Design program, passionate about creating user-friendly and visually appealing digital experiences. With a strong foundation in design principles and a growing skill set in front-end development, I aspire to become a front-end developer who specializes in crafting exceptional User Interfaces (UI) and User Experiences (UX).

What I Bring to the Table

- Design Sensibility: I have a keen eye for aesthetics and an understanding of user-centered design principles. I believe that design should not only be visually pleasing but also highly functional.

- Technical Proficiency: Through my education and personal projects, I have gained proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enabling me to translate design concepts into interactive and responsive web interfaces.

- User-Centric Approach: I am passionate about creating digital solutions that prioritize the needs and preferences of the end-users. I conduct thorough user research and usability testing to ensure that the products I design are intuitive and user-friendly.

- Collaborative Spirit: I enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams, including developers, product managers, and fellow designers, to create cohesive and impactful digital products. I believe that teamwork and open communication are key to success in any project.
